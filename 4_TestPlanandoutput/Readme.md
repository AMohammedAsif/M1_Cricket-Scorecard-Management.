 "CRICKET SCORECARD MANAGEMENT"

**TEST PLAN:**

To start with, I have performed manual testing on the Airline Reservation System. Manual Testing is one of the oldest and rigorous methods of software testing. This testing strategy gives the best opportunity to check every page thoroughly and make sure it works in the expected manner. Due to the complexity of the various automation tools and the time available for testing. I preferred to use manual testing based on the fact that it is one of the best methods of testing suggested for a beginner.

It is storing all the records into file with all the player's details in mufti record.
